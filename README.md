# Welcome to RECORD!
RECORD is a microcontroller-based system for the design and implementation of behavioural trials with the ability to synchronise with other external nerual recording systems. RECORD has a variety of applications, but its main purpose is for behavioural neuroscience implementations.

The system offers modularity and customisability at its core. It includes 3D-printed components, electronics, and software.
## 3D printing
We have personally designed every 3D-printed component of the system, and have provided the AutoCAD files for editing, and the STL files for printing directly. 
## Electronics
The electronics that drive the RECORD system are cheap but effective. We use an embedded systems approach to allow for customisable trials that can either be automated, or performed manually. The embedded electronics work on a command-servicing routine, which will make the electronics react to commands sent by the user via serial communications. 
## Software
We have developed software packages designed specifically for our system. These packages allow scripting of customised trials, data creating and pre-processing, and even databasing. We have also provided example scripts that can be used as templates for designing your own behavioural trials!
