# Welcome to RECORD/pcb!
Our custom PCB was designed using [Autodesk EAGLE](http://eagle.autodesk.com/). We have provided our projects as a Zip file for importing into EAGLE and making modifications, as well as the Gerber files we used for printing the board. 
## Our custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
The printed circuit board serves as a relay center for the various signals that the RECORD hardware needs for function. It also houses various JST connectors to ensure secure connection of the different cable assemblies. Every component on the PCB is through-hole, useful for manual soldering of each component. 
## Resistor values
Resistor values depend mostly on the LEDs chosen for the system. They are mainly for stepping a higher voltage signal down for protection of the LEDs. The voltage divider section is used for protection of the microcontroller, in case input TTL signals cannot be adjusted to the microcontroller's operating range.
