# Welcome to RECORD/3dprinting!
The section contains all the 3D printing files needed for the RECORD system's arenas, as well as miscellaneous components we ended up making. Every piece can be downloaded and printed directly with the STL file, or edited with the CAD files provided.
## Designed with modularity in mind
The RECORD arenas are designed to be customisable and reconfigurable. We have validated our system using a square arena with reward sites at each corner, but the shape and size of the arena can be adjusted based on your lab's needs!
## Our dummy rat
The dummy rat we have used for testing animal detection efficacy can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:182233).
